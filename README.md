Smartwash 
In this project, we aimed to improve the bottleneck in the university’s laundry system. As Industrial Engineering students,
we applied Root Cause Analysis to identify the underlying problems.We developed a web-based platform that acts as a middleman,
connecting students with laundry service providers. On this platform, available laundry slots are listed on the website, 
allowing students to make requests only when a slot is open. If no slots are available, students cannot place a request.

Once a request is made, the laundry is collected directly from the student’s residence.
The system provides a real-time status indicator that shows the driver’s location and progress on the service/product page. 
After the laundry is completed, the system updates the service page to show completion, allowing students to request delivery of their clean clothes.

The laundry service provider then charges students residencer  based on the completed laundry per residence, using the data automatically provided by the system.

Installation/setup instructions
This system currently works through a website. The backend and frontend have been created but are not yet linked.
As a result, you cannot log in, but you can still access the dashboard page to get a real feel of how the website operates — since normally,
the dashboard is only accessible after signing up.

The Home, Contact Us, and Privacy Policy pages are repeated because there are versions for both logged-in and logged-out users.
The only differences between them are in the header and footer sections.

Click Home 1 to view the actual homepage. There is also an Admin Page that allows control over the product status displayed on the user’s product page.
